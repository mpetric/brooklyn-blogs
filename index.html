      <h3>About this Project</h3>
      <p>This is Assignment #5 for XSAVI780. For this project I used the neighborhood tabulation area shapefile available on NYC's Bytes of the Big Apple to identify the approximate borders of Brooklyn neighborhoods. I then compiled a list of blogs focused on particular neighborhoods and used QGIS to merge the two data sets and export as a GeoJSON file.</p>
      <p>
        There are several improvements that I'd like to make to this page:
        <ol>
          <li>Rather than clicking to call a popup window, I'd like to have a hover effect which populates the neighborhoodName and blogTitle div elements on the sidebar.</li>
          <li>I'd like to replace the click event, which currently generates the popup window, with a hyperlink to the Blog website.</li>
          <li>I'd like to create a hover effect which darkens the polygon on hover.</li>
        </ol>
      </p>
